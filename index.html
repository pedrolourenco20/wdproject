    <section id="About">
        <h2 class="neon-box">About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Pedro, 21-year-old IT and Multimedia student at University of Lisbon.
        <p>Though my home is set in Portugal, I currently reside in Ireland, further fulfilling my studies at the
            University of Limerick where I continue to explore my passion for technology, creativity, and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>With a keen interest in graphic design and web development, I chose this course as my way to go since I
            enjoy blending scientific principles with digital creativity to craft engaging projects. Whether it's
            coding, designing, filmmaking, or brainstorming ideas, I thrive on turning thoughts into reality.</p>

        <p>Beyond academics, you'll often find me experimenting with new creative arts, refining my design skills, or
            diving into computing, music or film projects. I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and push boundaries
            in both
            engineering and digital media.</p>

        <h2 class="neon-box">More about me</h2>
        <p>I dream big, so I don't have a particular target set in my mind, rather I have multiple ones. I strive to
            blossom knowledge on various fields. Because of that, I am always eager to learn more: either it be about my
            typical area of expertise or outside it. I like to learn about biology and physics and I often combine my
            leisure time with my working time; I sometimes can't differentiate work from leisure, if the topic interests me, as both are forms of enjoyment for me. I would love to work on
            any hardware engineering job or a software / video game development project.</p>
        <p>I find Carl Sagan, David Lynch and Jean-Michel Basquiat to be my biggest inspirations in my field. I like how
            the three of these notorious persons intertwine within my way of life, though in separate ways.</p>
        <p>Perhaps my biggest project was co-directing a shortfilm made by a friend of mine a few years ago. I also
            featured in a music video last year, and also helped a friend of mine creating a small budget video game for
            his final academic graduation.</p>

        <div class="Reflection">
            <h3>ðŸ”¹ What this small portfolio means</h3>
            <p>I feel this portfolio has a lot of room to grow, and I'd love to expand it beyond its limits. Whether it
                would be with more tabs, new pages and resources, I'm fond of creating opportunities to cultivate
                businesses or projects and this is no different.</p>

            <p>I'm eager to learn how to incorporate more interactive elements in this website to fully maximise its
                potential. I take inspiration from an artist named <a href="https://miguelluz.pt/videos"
                    target="_blank">Miguel Luz</a> whose professional portfolio I also find inspiring for my own.</p>

            <p>Not only his website feels authentic and resourceful, it also incorporates a browser decision-making
                game, and I'd love to do something similiar to one of my own; though adding my touch to it. I would also
                love to add the details, and implement effects within the tab, such as rollovers and fade outs.</p>

<section id="Design">
    <h2 class="neon-box">My design process</h2>
    <div class="box">
        <div class="content">
            <img src="design prototype.jpeg" alt="Design Process" class="box-image" onclick="openLightbox(this)">
            
            <p class="box-text">
                Before coming up with the HTML code for the portfolio, I started off by drawing a small
                sketch of how I visualised the website. I drew the prototype relatively simple, in order to allocate
                room for change and improvisation. The design was relatively accessible to come up with, so I would say
                the most difficult part of the project as a whole, would be implementing the JavaScript sections
                whilst making them functional. 
                After finalising the design, I focused on building the structure and layout. I made sure to optimise
                the code for responsiveness and accessibility. The portfolio's main objective was to showcase my web 
                development skills and design approach, and I feel that it turned out to be a fair representation of 
                my abilities.
